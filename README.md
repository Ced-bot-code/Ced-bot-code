My Journey
</summary>
    When I was in high school, I started studying HTML, CSS, and basic coding. However, during that time, the programming language taught in school was QBASIC. Honestly, I didn’t like QBASIC—sorry!

In 2015, I enrolled at Sibonga Community College as an IT student. Unfortunately, I had to quit because tuition wasn't free back then. During that break, I studied a bit of Algebra. Even though it was challenging, I pushed through and trained myself to solve problems because I wanted to learn.

I returned to school in 2018, about two years after I stopped. This time, the units were free—hehehe—so I grabbed the opportunity to continue, despite financial and material difficulties. I worked to support my studies, though I wasn’t able to stick with the job for long. Still, I’m very thankful to those who helped me continue going to school. Their support allowed me to keep pursuing my goals and dreams.

When the lockdown came, I bought a phone so I could continue studying and keep up with my coursework. Eventually, I made a friend who had a computer, and little by little, I started learning more about programming. Once we finished our school projects, we would sometimes go swimming in the sea since they lived nearby.

In my third year, second semester, I made new friends from other batches. One of them was also into programming, and through him, I met more friends. We hung out, worked on projects together, and shared knowledge—whether serious or silly topics, we talked about everything.

When my friends and I finally graduated, I felt truly happy. We all made it, and I’m grateful we did it together.

       How did I learned programming?
    </summary>
    What I usually do is read first, then practice. After that, I take notes so I don't forget, because not all the code I practice is easy to memorize.

       What was my thesis/CAPSTONE when I was a student?
   </summary>
    It's a voting system a web-based application intended for Student Government election. We are four members at that time
      Our roles are:
        Me - The main developer
        He - The frontend developer
        then the two guys are on the papers.
    It is not easy to develop a CAPSTONE/Thesis project It is more on research, planning and testing.

        What were my hangouts when I was a student?
    </summary>
