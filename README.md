My Journey
</summary>
    When I was a high school student I have started to study about HTML and CSS and basic coding but QBASIC is what I taught in our time. I don't like QBASIC sorry. In 2015, I enrolled in Sibonga Community College as an IT Student. I just quit because it wasn't free at that time. What I did at that time, I studied a little about Algebra until I was trained to solve it even though it was difficult for me to overcome my needs so that I could learn. When I went back to school that was 2018, about two years had passed since I stopped. I was able to continue because the units are free hehehe. So I grabbed the opportunity to continue even though it was difficult about financial and material. I worked so that I could sustain my studies but I didn't last long but I am thankful to them that they helped me to go to school then I can continue with my plans in my life because I have something plans and desires.

   When the lockdown came, I bought a phone to study and update my studies. Until I made a friend who had a computer, I slowly learned about programming until I learned. 
When we finish and do our project, we will immediately bathe in the sea because they are near there. When I started my 3rd year second semester, I made friends with from different batch, so he did programming until I became friends with his other friends, then we went to wherever we went. We are still together in the capstone project. We will share our knowledge and any topics to talk about, stupid or right. When my friends and I graduated, I was happy that we all finished.

       How did I learned programming?
    </summary>
    What I do is just read, then I practice after I'm done I make notes so that I don't forget because not all the codes you practice can be memorized easily.

       What was my thesis/CAPSTONE when I was a student?
   </summary>
    It's a voting system a web-based application intended for Student Government election. We are four members at that time
      Our roles are:
        Me - The main developer
        He - The frontend developer
        then the two guys are on the papers.
    It is not easy to develop a CAPSTONE/Thesis project It is more on research, planning and testing.
